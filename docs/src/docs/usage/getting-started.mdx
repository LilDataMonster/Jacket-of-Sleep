## Introduction

The documented setup here is used get a developer up and running quickly implement and deploy The Loch Sense Monster software stack onto a device.

## Dependency Setup

Dependencies are required in order to compile and target the device.

- ESP-IDF
  - https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/
  - https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/
- ESP-IDF-LIB
  - https://esp-idf-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To setup the development environment, the ESP-IDF environment variables must be set:

| Environment Variable | Description      |
|----------------------|------------------|
|`IDF_PATH`            | ESP-IDF path     |
|`IDF_LIB_PATH`        | ESP-IDF-LIB path |

```bash
# define location to store dependencies
export BUILD_ENV=$HOME

# clone dependencies
cd $BUILD_ENV
git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
git clone https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib.git

# setup environment variables
export IDF_PATH=$BUILD_ENV/esp-idf
source $IDF_PATH/add_path.sh
source $IDF_PATH/exort.sh

export IDF_LIB_PATH=$BUILD_ENV/esp-idf-lib
```

## Set Target Device

Before configuration of the build, setting a device target must be done to indicate what chip is being targeted for the build. The primary two options are the `ESP32` and the `ESP32-S2` device. ESP8266 is not officially supported but will likely work as well.

To set the target device, run the following for the ESP32:

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32
```

For ESP32-S2 devices, run the following:

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s2
```

## Configuration

Configuration parameters can be defined using the ESP-IDF configuration menu by executing the following commands and modify custom project configurations within the menu.

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

The `Monster Configuration` menu defines several parameters used for the software stack.

| Menu Option          | Description      |
|----------------------|------------------|
| WiFi SSID            | WiFi SSID AP to connect to |
| WiFi Password        | WiFi Password to connect to AP with |
| WiFi listen interval | Number of intervals for station to listen to becon from AP |
| Power Save Mode      | Power save mode for the ESP32 to use |
| Max CPU Frequency    | Maximum CPU frequency to use for dynamic frequency scaling |
| Min CPU Frequency    | Minimum CPU frequency to use for dynamic frequency scaling, should be set to a factor of XTAL frequency |
| DHT11 GPIO Pin       | GPIO pin to read the DHT11 sensor |
| HTTP POST Endpoint   | HTTP endpoint to post data |

## Build and Compile

Building and compiling the code will begin creating the required binaries for the build and store them in the `build/` folder.

To begin building the code run:

```bash
idf.py build
```

## Flash and Monitor

To flash the build, find the serial location of the device on the host machine (`/dev/ttyUSB0` in this case) and run the `flash` command. Use the `monitor` command to read the serial output of the device. The baudrate is defined in the menu options discussed prior.

```bash
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```
